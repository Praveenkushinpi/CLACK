# Day 1
## `23 May , Friday , 19:25 pm IST`
### Today i am starting the development of my custom keyboard 

*why keyboard?*

keyboard is one of the project that i want to work on after __*learning*__ some basics of elctronics because this is just spectcular to use something on daily basis , which is __*made by you*__ . it will always remind me of that how i created this keyboard and now using this keyboard and now i can fix any bug by using my keyboard , which is so __*inspiring*__ . 

## __*What i did today ?*__
### i am going with the default 60% layout keyboard but i want few features in it first it should be RGB or at least backlight and have to be split keyboard and a oled screen and can work with every os and a hand rest and magnetic connection if it is under the budget and i want it to be more low profile side like i don't need that clacky and clicky sound to loud cause *i don't my neighbour knock my door at 2am complaining about keyboard sound*
