## Day 1 — Keyboard Layout Created 

Today marks the first official entry for the **Clack** keyboard project!

 **Progress Update**  
I finalized the **keyboard layout**—the arrangement of keys, row staggering, and the overall form factor. I'm aiming for a compact yet comfortable 60% layout, but with a few tweaks for usability (like dedicated arrow keys and an extra macro column).
