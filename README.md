#  Clack — A Custom Mechanical Keyboard Build

Clack is a personal mechanical keyboard build crafted with a balance of sound, feel, and function — all under a budget of $150. Designed for a smooth typing experience and a clean aesthetic, Clack is as much a daily driver as it is a passion project.

---

##  Inspiration

The name **Clack** comes from the satisfying sound of tactile switches meeting carefully tuned stabilizers. Built for comfort and customizability, this keyboard is a love letter to DIY mechanical keyboard culture.
